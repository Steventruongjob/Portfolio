Works that I've created

Web.py is the python script that I wrote that interacts with an HTML page, where the user inputs data.
The data is then analyzed, and relevant information is outputted.
SpectralLines.py is the modification of Dr. Adam Burgasser's work in order for the data to be correctly outputted onto the HTML page.
